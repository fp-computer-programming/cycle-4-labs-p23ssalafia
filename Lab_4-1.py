#User inputs their First and Last Name:
First_Name = input ('Please write your first name')
Last_Name = input ('Please write you last name')

# Recieved user input and prints the full name with an added space.
Full_Name = First_Name + ' ' + Last_Name
print(Full_Name)

# Does not seem to be any issue with the output when ' ' is put in.
